 * Currently, this only works on PostgreSQL 10. Adding support for older

 *
 * 1) pg_uuid_t hidden in uuid.c (can be solved by local struct definition)
 *
 * 2) pg_strong_random not available (can fallback to random, probably)
 *
 * 3) functions defined as PARALLEL SAFE, which fails on pre-9.6 releases

 * uuid_sequence_nextval
 *	generate sequential UUID using a sequence
 *
 * The sequence-based sequential UUID generator define the group size
 * and group count based on number of UUIDs generated.
 *
 * The block_size (65546 by default) determines the number of UUIDs with
 * the same prefix, and block_count (65536 by default) determines the
 * number of blocks before wrapping around to 0. This means that with
 * the default values, the generator wraps around every ~2B UUIDs.
 *
 * You may increase (or rather decrease) the parameters if needed, e.g,
 * by lowering the block size to 256, in wich case the cycle interval
 * is only 16M values.
